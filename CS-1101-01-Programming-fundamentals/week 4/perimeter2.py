# This function calculates the perimeter of rectangle
# The formula is "2(l + b)". Where ‘l’ is Length and ‘b’ is Breadth
def perimeter(l,b):
    # Calculating result by adding Length and Breadth as an initial step
    result = l+b
    # Printing the result
    print(result)
    # Right now it returns 0
    return 0

# Calling the function with parameters
